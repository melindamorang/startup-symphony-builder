startup-symphony-builder

This repo contains the HTML components used to build [The Startup Symphony](https://startupsymphony.org/) website and a homemade python generator that puts all the components together. (This is before I realized that stuff like Jinja exist for doing exactly this.)  The final output pages are in the https://github.com/melindamorang/startup-symphony repo, which is a GitHub Pages site.
