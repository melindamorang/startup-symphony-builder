<h1>Writing bylaws</h1>

<h2>What are bylaws?</h2>

<p>Your orchestra needs bylaws.  Bylaws define your organization's structure and will be needed 
for your <a href="./nonprofit.html">501(c)(3) nonprofit application</a> and possibly for 
<a href="./bankaccount.html">starting a bank account</a>.</p>

<p>Bylaws contain information defining your mission, purpose, objectives, activities (broadly 
speaking), membership, the structure of your board and officers, conflict of interest and 
non-discrimination policies, and legal jargon necessary for nonprofit organizations.  Bylaws 
define the structure of your organization, not detailed policies or things that might change 
often.  After you initially adopt them, you should not have to change your bylaws unless the 
fundamental structure or purpose or activities of your organization change.  Creating your 
bylaws is a chance to thoroughly think through what you want your organization to be.</p>

<h2>Creating bylaws</h2>

<p>Your board and/or your membership should vote to officially adopt your bylaws, and you 
should review them periodically after that.  The bylaws should spell out the method for 
updating the bylaws in the future.</p>

<p>When creating bylaws for the RCO, I wrote them up myself after looking at several 
examples and then reviewed them with my board members section-by-section during a meeting.  
When the final draft was ready, I sent them out to the orchestra membership for review, and 
several people did actually take the time to read them and provide feedback.  This method
worked fine for us.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use the 
<a href="./RCO_Bylaws.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCO's original bylaws</a> as an 
example and to copy and paste as much of the text as you like for your own organization.

<a href="http://www.dextercommunityorchestra.org/dcobylaws.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dexter Community Orchestra's 
bylaws</a> (a group I used to play in and run, though I did not write their bylaws).  I 
recommend looking at several sample bylaws before finishing yours.</p>

<h2>Some special considerations</h2>

<p>When creating the RCO bylaws, I added some specific things designed to avoid certain 
future problems I anticipated.  I will describe some of the decisions I made here.</p>

<p>I chose to explicitly define the duties of every board member in the bylaws, rather than 
leaving the number flexible and the duties vague.  I didn't want the orchestra to be weighted 
down by people who serve on the board in name only and don't actually contribute anything 
meaningful.  For the same reason, I included a clause stating that board members could be 
removed from office by a vote of the other board members for failure to adequately perform 
their duties or for engaging in activities harmful to the organization.  I did not want us to 
get stuck with an officer who didn't wasn't pulling his weight with no way to get rid of him 
until the next election.  It is possible that we might end up amending the number and duties 
of the officers described in this section more frequently than I would like as our activities 
change and the duties of the officers solidify (since we're still figuring out all the work 
that has to be done), but changing duties and activities seem like things that should warrant 
a bylaw review anyway.  You can read a fuller discussion about <a href="./board.html">my decisions 
for structuring the board </a>elsewhere.</p>

<p>I put a clause in our bylaws that specifically forbids the orchestra from compensating 
musician members for playing in the orchestra.  If, at some point in the future, the 
orchestra's leadership wants to pay members for their services, this would be a fundamental 
change to the mission and purpose of the organization, so the bylaws would have to be amended, 
and amendment is done by a vote of the musician members themselves.  This prevents an 
overly-ambitious future leader or music director from deciding to convert the organization to 
a "professional" orchestra against the desires of the orchestra's members.  I have known of a 
few other groups that started as community groups and later converted to professional or 
semi-professional groups.  While the quality of music they produced went up, they became 
inaccessible to many musicians who wished to play in them and ceased to be "community" 
orchestras.  If this type of progression is your goal, that's fine, but if it isn't, I 
recommend adding some blockages in your bylaws.</p>

<p>Some things I purposefully left as decisions for the board.  My board decided that we 
would not charge membership dues, but we didn't think a future decision to charge dues should 
warrant a change to the bylaws.  Consequently, the bylaws state that membership dues will be 
determined by the board.  Similarly, the bylaws state that the music director and any guest 
artists can be either volunteers or paid (and neither category can be a voting member of the 
organization).</p>
