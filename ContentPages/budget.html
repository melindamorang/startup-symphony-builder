<h1>Creating a budget</h1>

<p>Needless to say, your orchestra should have a budget.  You shouldn't spend money on things you haven't budgeted for without special consideration, and you should revisit your budget periodically and see how your income and expenditures match up with what you anticipated when you made the budget.  Breaking up your income and expenditures by concert is often useful.</p>

<p>Here are some possible sources of income and some estimates of costs for an orchestra just starting off.  Some of these might not apply to you, and some of them might be mutually exclusive.</p>
