document management, Google Drive, collaborate

<h1>Managing and sharing documents</h1>

<p>Running an orchestra is a collaborative process, and you will likely have a lot of documents you will want to
share and keep up to date.  Some examples include a personnel roster, a budget and financial ledger, a list of 
publicity contacts, your meeting minutes, official logo image files, official letterhead, donation thank-you 
letter templates, music library catalog, etc.  It is important to keep these documents accessible to the orchestra's
current and future administrators and to minimize confusion over document ownership and versioning.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Drive</a> is a great way to manage your 
documents.  It serves two primary purposes.  First, you can share documents and collaborate easily; it handles 
versioning, so you don't have to worry about people working from different versions of the same document, and it's
easy for everyone to look at the same thing.  You can even have multiple people editing the same document at the same
time.  Second, it all lives in the cloud, so your documents are automatically backed up, owned by the group, and 
accessible from any computer or mobile device (if you're logged in or the document is public).  If your treasurer 
gets hit by a bus tomorrow, your budget and ledger will still be easily accessible to your treasurer's replacement.</p>

<p>Google Drive allows you to author different types of documents: text documents (like Word), spreadsheets, forms, 
and some others.  The forms are super useful for creating sign-ups and polls.  You can create folders to organize 
your documents.  You can control who has read and write access to each document and folder.  You can upload documents
of any type from your own computer.  Individuals can author documents through their own Google accounts and share 
them with the orchestra's account, so you don't have to give everybody access to the orchestra's login credentials.</p>

<p>Google Drive is free, and it's part of your <a href="./googleaccount.html">Google account</a>.</p>

<p>The RCO has been using Google Drive reasonably successfully.  Some of our members have had trouble using it, but most have 
been able to figure it out.  Several years ago, the Dexter Community Orchestra's administration had less success, but 
technology and people's ability to use it advance quickly.  The technological skill level of your administrators will 
likely play a role in how you decide to organize your documents, but I definitely recommend using some kind of 
cloud-based system if you can find a way to make it work.  If you can coax them into learning Google Drive, or one of many other online document storage sites, it will
no doubt serve your organization well.  That said, probably what matters more than the technology you pick is the level of commitment and willingness of your board members to figure something out and work with it.</p>
