<h1>Why your orchestra should have a Google account</h1>

<p>If you set up a designated Google account for your orchestra, you will have access to a bunch of useful
and free tools beyond a simple e-mail account.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use Google Voice to <a href="./phone.html">obtain a free phone number</a>.</li>
	<li>Use <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Calendar</a> to show your rehearsal and concert
	schedule, track administrative deadlines, etc.  Your members can add the orchestra's calendar to their own Google
	calendar, and you can embed the calendar on your website.</li>
	<li>Use Google Drive to <a href="./docmanagement.html">manage and share documents</a></li>
	<li>Use Google Drive forms for member sign-ups and polls</li>
	<li>Create YouTube playlists of study recordings for your musicians and post videos of your own concerts. You can
	embed these on your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, Google offers <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special features for nonprofits</a> that your organization might find valuable.</p>
