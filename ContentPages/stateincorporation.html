<h1>Incorporating as a business at the state level</h1>

<p>A nonprofit organization is a corporation, just a special classification of corporation, 
and you have to go through the same incorporation procedure that any other business operating 
in your state has to go through.  You should check with your Secretary of State's office to 
find out the correct requirement and procedures.  The terminology can be rather confusing,
but you will most likely want to incorporate as a "nonprofit public benefit corporation".
Note that incorporation does not convey tax-exempt status to you.  You must file 
federal and state <a href="./nonprofit.html">applications for exemption</a> separately.</p>

<p>To incorporate at the state level in California, you have to file form 
<a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
ARTS-PB-501(c)(3) Articles of Incorporation of a Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation</a> 
to the California Secretary of State's office and pay a $30 filing fee.  You have to 
provide a physical address for the corporation; a PO box will not work. Your 
<a href="https://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/business-mailboxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local UPS store</a> 
can provide a mailbox with a physical address, for a fee, if you don't have another option. You also have to
choose an official name for your corporation, a name which does not currently belong to any
other incorporated entity in the state or is not overly similar to one.  The name
you use for incorporation need not be the name you actually use to refer to yourself, but
it will be the name that appears in any official records.</p>

<p>It took us the RCO about two months to be granted our state incorporation, but we had one 
hitch along the way with the official name of our organization and had to re-submit our 
application.  It would have taken about three weeks otherwise.</p>

<p>In California, newly-incorporated entities have to file a 
<a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
Statement of Information Form SI-100</a> within 90 days of their incorporation, and every two 
years after that.  Check if your state has any similar requirements, and be aware of any other 
<a href="./filingrequirements.html">annual filing requirements</a></p>

<p>After your incorporation, you will probably need to separately apply for state income 
tax exemption, but it is probably easier to do this after you have received your 
<a href="./nonprofit.html">federal 501(c)(3) nonprofit status</a>, unless you foresee a
significant delay in that process.</p>

<p>If you operate in California and plan to do any fundraising, you additionally have to register with the 
<a href="http://oag.ca.gov/charities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the Attorney General</a> by filing 
<a href="http://oag.ca.gov/charities/forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form CT-1</a> within 30 days of first receiving any 
donated assets.  I do not know if other states have similar registration requirements.  I also do not know
why the various offices in the State of California can't just share information with each other to reduce the
number of forms you have to file.</p>
