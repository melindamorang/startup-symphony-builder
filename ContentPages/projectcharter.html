<h1>Create a project charter</h1>

<p>I took a project management training course at work, and it was mind-blowingly helpful!  There's a lot to
	the art and science of effective project management, but the most valuable and easy-to-implement activities
	is creating a project charter.  A project charter helps you to clearly define and communicate what you're
	trying to do, why, and how, by setting down the following items in writing:	
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Goal</li>
	<li>Background and justification</li>
	<li>Deliverables and acceptance criteria</li>
	<li>Scope and activities</li>
	<li>Timeline and deadlines</li>
	<li>Required resources</li>
	<li>Stakeholders</li>
	<li>Dependencies and related projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you don't use any other project management techniques and have no training in project management, creating
	a project charter can be an incredibly valuable step to help you think through everything that will be involved in
	starting your orchestra.  It's also a good way to define must-haves and nice-to-haves while thinking through your
	<a href="./MSP.html">"minimum shippable product"</a>.  I highly recommend giving this a try after you've figured out
	your <a href="./goals.html">vision and goals</a>.
</p>

<p>A project charter is also super useful in communicating your plan with others: with potential members or volunteers, with
	potential conductors, with anyone you're trying to get resources from, etc.
